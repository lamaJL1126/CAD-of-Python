# CAD_of_Python
*The point about start.*

### Creation of CAD software based on Python.
I'm not very familiar with Python, so I'll be learning it in parallel with the project. I use ChatGPT to help me to learn, but the code and logic are done by myself (ChatGPT also helps with the English grammar).

### How to use
You need to install ezdxf
```
pip install ezdxf
```


# beta

## `v0.1`
Just trying to figure out how to use ezdxf.


## `v0.2`
In fact, it is just a coordinate saver, and it can't save any files. I also want to try the new functionality, but it has a lot of problems, and the code is too messy. I will fix the problems in the next beta releases.

### The new functionality
Now you can:
- Select the point to edit.
- Search for or clear the point data.
- Stop the program and break it.

### The Problems
We need to fix:
- Messy code.
- Crashes due to illegal inputs.
- Can't choose where to save the DXF file or save it at all.
- Creating the new functionality is too difficult.

## `v0.3 (predict)`
