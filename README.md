# CAD_of_Python
*The point about start.*

## Creation of CAD software based on Python.
I'm not very familiar with Python, so I'll be learning it in parallel with the project.

I use ChatGPT to help me to learn, but the code and logic are done by myself (ChatGPT also helps with the English grammar). ~~*THX ChatGPT Lol*~~

### How to use
You need to install ezdxf

```
pip install ezdxf
```
