# CAD_of_Python
*The point about start.*

## Creation of CAD software based on Python.
Compared to other programming languages, I'm not as proficient in Python, so I'll be working on a project to learn it simultaneously. Also, my English is poor, lol. By the way, I use ChatGPT to help me, but the code and logic are done by myself (ChatGPT also helps with the English grammar). ~~*THX ChatGPT Lol*~~
